/*
Steps to One
Problem Statement: Given a positive integer n, write a program that returns the minimum number of steps to reach 1 by performing one of the following operations: Subtract 1 from it. If it is divisible by 2, divide it by 2. If it is divisible by 3, divide it by 3. For example- from 5 , subtracting 1 it will be 4, then it will be divided by 2 and become 2 then again it will be divided by 2 and become 1. Total 3 steps will be needed.
Input: The program will take an integer NN as input.
Output: The output will print the number of steps to become 1.
Constraints: 0 â‰¤ |N| â‰¤ 1000
Example: Enter number
Input: 5
Output: 3
Notes: None
